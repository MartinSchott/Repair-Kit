## Base Pin

> Currently not used in the main manufacturing

A simple 3D printable pin for a defined distance between base plates. Requires an empty bore hole and a M3.5x12mm (can be longer) screw with countersunk head.

At least 3 per Layer needed, defined by the highest item on the layer. [FreeCAD](CAD/Pin/Base-Pin.FCStd) Source Files can be edited to a hight needed.
